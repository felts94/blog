## Education
### Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University: Computer Engineering, Bachelor's Degree
I started out as an Electrical engineer but found myself writing code to solve most of my homework and exams. This lead me to change majors into computer engineering, which
focuses on creating practical solutions with software to solve real world problems.
